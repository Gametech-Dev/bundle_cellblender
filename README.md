# Create CellBlender Bundle

A set of scripts to create bundled versions of CellBlender (with Blender,
MCell, BNG, etc).

## Linux

Run `./make_cellblender.sh`. This should take several minutes. Once it's
complete, you should have a directory called
`blender-2.77a-linux-glibc211-x86_64` and a corresponding zip file called
`cellblender1.1_bundle_linux.zip`.

## Windows

Run `./make_cellblender.ps1` from PowerShell ISE. Note: you need to use ISE and
not simply PowerShell. This should take several minutes. Once it's complete,
you should have a directory called `blender-2.77a-windows64` and a
corresponding zip file called `cellblender1.1_bundle_windows.zip`.
